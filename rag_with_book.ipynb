       "\"Preface\\nMore information on the Codes development process is available on the NRC's website.\\nNational Building Code of Canada 2020\\nThe NBC sets out technical provisions for the design and construction of new buildings. It\\nalso applies to the alteration, change of use and demolition of existing buildings.\\nThe NBC establishes requirements to address the following five objectives:\\n• safety\\n• health\\n• accessibility\\n• fire and structural protection of buildings\\n• environment\\nCode provisions do not necessarily address all the characteristics of buildings that might be\\nconsidered to have a bearing on the Code's objectives. Through the extensive consensus\\nprocess used to develop and maintain the National Model Codes (see the section entitled\\nDevelopment of the National Model Codes), the Codes-user community has decided which\\ncharacteristics should be regulated through the NBC.\\nThe provisions of the NBC can be considered as the minimum acceptable measures required\\nto adequately achieve the above-listed objectives, as recommended by the CCBFC. Once they\\nare adopted into law or regulation by an authority having jurisdiction, the provisions become\\nminimum acceptable requirements representing the minimum level of performance required\\nto achieve the objectives that is acceptable to the adopting authority.\\nThe NBC is a model code which, when adopted or adapted by a province or territory,\\nbecomes a regulation. It is not a guideline on building design or construction. The design of a\\ntechnically sound building depends upon many factors beyond compliance with building\\nregulations. Such factors include the availability of knowledgeable practitioners who have\\nreceived appropriate education, training and experience and who are familiar with the\\nprinciples of good building practice and experience using reference manuals and technical\\nguides.\\nThe NBC does not list acceptable proprietary building products. It establishes the criteria that\\nbuilding materials, products and assemblies must meet. Some of these criteria are explicitly\\nstated in the NBC while others are incorporated by reference to material or product standards\\npublished by standards development organizations. Only those portions of the standards\\nrelated to the objectives of this Code are mandatory parts of the NBC.\\nRelationship between the NBC and the NFC\\nThe NBC and NFC each contain provisions that relate to the safety of persons in buildings\\nin the event of a fire and the protection of buildings from the effects of fire.(1) These two\\nmodel codes are developed as complementary and coordinated documents to minimize\\nthe possibility of their containing conflicting provisions. It is expected that buildings\\ncomply with both the NBC and the NFC.\\nThe NBC covers the fire safety and fire protection features that are required to be\\nincorporated in a building at the time of its original construction. Building codes typically\\nno longer apply once a building is occupied, unless the building is undergoing alteration\\nor change of use, or being demolished.\\nThe NFC covers:\\n• the ongoing maintenance and use of the fire safety and fire protection features\\nincorporated in buildings\\n• the conduct of activities that might cause fire hazards in and around buildings\\n(1)\\nThe NFC also applies to other types of facilities besides buildings (e.g. tank farms and storage\\nyards). Those applications are not discussed here.\\nvi\\nNational Building Code of Canada 2020 Volume 1\\n© His Majesty the King in Right of Canada, as represented by the National Research Council of Canada, 2022 © Sa Majesté le Roi du chef du Canada, représenté par le Conseil national de recherches du Canada, 2022\\n\""

      "Preface • limitations on hazardous contents in and around buildings • the establishment of fire safety plans • fire safety at construction and demolition sites In addition, the NFC contains provisions regarding fire safety and fire protection features that must be added to existing buildings when certain hazardous activities or processes are introduced into these buildings. Some of the NFC's provisions are incorporated by reference in the NBC and, thus, may apply to original construction, alterations, or changes in use. Relationship between the NBC and the NECB The provisions in Section 9.36. of Division B of the NBC are tied to the environment objective. These provisions, which apply to housing and small buildings, have a similar scope to that of the NECB, except that they do not address lighting and electrical power systems. The NECB is referenced in NBC Section 9.36. as an acceptable solution. Code Requirements Most NBC requirements address at least one of the Code's five stated objectives (safety, health, accessibility, fire and structural protection of buildings, and environment). In processing proposed changes or additions to any of the National Model Codes, the CCBFC considers many issues such as the following: • Does the proposed requirement provide the minimum level of performance—and no more than the minimum—needed to achieve the Code's objectives? • Will persons responsible for Code compliance be able to act on or implement the requirement using commonly accepted practices? • Will enforcement agencies be able to enforce the requirement? • Are the costs of implementing the requirement justifiable? • Have the potential policy implications of the requirement been identified and addressed? • Is there broad consensus on this requirement among Code users representing all facets of the design and construction industries as well as among provincial and territorial governments? Guidelines for requesting changes to the NBC are available on the NRC's website. Objective-Based Code Format The NBC has been published in an objective-based code format since 2005. As described in more detail in the section entitled Structure of the NBC, the Code comprises three Divisions: • Division A, which defines the scope of the Code and contains the objectives, the functional statements and the conditions necessary to achieve compliance; • Division B, which contains acceptable solutions (commonly referred to as “technical requirements”) deemed to satisfy the objectives and functional statements listed in Division A; and • Division C, which contains administrative provisions. Most of the requirements in Division B are linked to three types of information: • objectives (Code objectives, such as safety or health, which individual requirements help to address), • functional statements (statements of the functions of the building that a particular requirement helps to achieve), and • intent statements (detailed statements of the specific intent of the requirement).

In Canada, provincial and territorial governments have the authority to enact legislation that regulates building design and construction within their jurisdictions. This may involve the adoption of the NBC without change or with modifications to suit local needs, and the enactment of other laws and regulations regarding building design and construction, including requirements for professional involvement. The NBC is a model code in the sense that it helps promote consistency among provincial and territorial building codes. Persons involved in the design or construction of a building should consult the provincial or territorial jurisdiction concerned to find out which building code is applicable. This edition of the NBC succeeds the 2015 edition. Development of the National Model Codes The CCBFC, an independent committee established by the National Research Council of Canada (NRC), is responsible for the content of the National Model Codes. The CCBFC is made up of volunteers from across the country and from all facets of the Codes-user community. Members of the CCBFC and its standing committees include builders, engineers, skilled trade workers, architects, building owners, building operators, fire and building officials, manufacturers, and representatives of general interests. The CCBFC is advised on scope, policy and technical issues pertaining to the Codes by the Provincial/Territorial Policy Advisory Committee on Codes (PTPACC), which is a committee of senior representatives from provincial/territorial ministries responsible for building, fire, plumbing and energy regulation in their jurisdictions. The PTPACC was created by the provinces and territories, with provision of guidance to the CCBFC as one of its main functions. Through the PTPACC, the provinces and territories are engaged in every phase of the Codes development process. Codes Canada staff within the Construction Research Centre at the NRC provide technical and administrative support to the CCBFC and its standing committees, and coordinate the provision of evidence-based research to inform Codes development. The NRC publishes the National Model Codes and periodic revisions to the Codes to address pressing issues. The broader Codes-user community also makes significant contributions to the Codes development process by submitting requests for changes or additions to the Codes and by commenting on the proposed changes during the public reviews that precede each new edition. The CCBFC takes into consideration the advice received from the provinces and territories as well as Codes users' comments at each stage of Codes development. The scope and content of the National Model Codes are determined on a consensus basis, which involves the review of technical, policy and practical concerns and discussion of the implications of these concerns.

       "  'content': \"Preface More information on the Codes development process is available on the NRC's website. National Building Code of Canada 2020 The NBC sets out technical provisions for the design and construction of new buildings. It also applies to the alteration, change of use and demolition of existing buildings. The NBC establishes requirements to address the following five objectives: • safety • health • accessibility • fire and structural protection of buildings • environment Code provisions do not necessarily address all the characteristics of buildings that might be considered to have a bearing on the Code's objectives. Through the extensive consensus process used to develop and maintain the National Model Codes (see the section entitled Development of the National Model Codes), the Codes-user community has decided which characteristics should be regulated through the NBC. The provisions of the NBC can be considered as the minimum acceptable measures required to adequately achieve the above-listed objectives, as recommended by the CCBFC. Once they are adopted into law or regulation by an authority having jurisdiction, the provisions become minimum acceptable requirements representing the minimum level of performance required to achieve the objectives that is acceptable to the adopting authority. The NBC is a model code which, when adopted or adapted by a province or territory, becomes a regulation. It is not a guideline on building design or construction. The design of a technically sound building depends upon many factors beyond compliance with building regulations. Such factors include the availability of knowledgeable practitioners who have received appropriate education, training and experience and who are familiar with the principles of good building practice and experience using reference manuals and technical guides. The NBC does not list acceptable proprietary building products. It establishes the criteria that building materials, products and assemblies must meet. Some of these criteria are explicitly stated in the NBC while others are incorporated by reference to material or product standards published by standards development organizations. Only those portions of the standards related to the objectives of this Code are mandatory parts of the NBC. \"}]"

       "[Document(page_content='Chapter 1\\nThe Worlds of Database  \\nSystems\\nDatabases today are essential to every business. Whenever you visit a major \\nWeb site — Google, Yahoo!, Amazon.com, or thousands of smaller sites that \\nprovide information — there is a database behind the scenes serving up the \\ninformation you request. Corporations maintain all their important records in \\ndatabases. Databases are likewise found at the core of many scientific investi\\xad\\ngations. They represent the data gathered by astronomers, by investigators of \\nthe human genome, and by biochemists exploring properties of proteins, among \\nmany other scientific activities.\\nThe power of databases comes from a body of knowledge and technology \\nthat has developed over several decades and is embodied in specialized soft\\xad\\nware called a database management system,  or DBMS , or more colloquially a \\n“database system.” A DBMS is a powerful tool for creating and managing large \\namounts of data efficiently and allowing it to persist over long periods of time, \\nsafely. These systems are among the most complex types of software available. \\nIn this book, we shall learn how to design databases, how to write programs \\nin the various languages associated with a DBMS, and how to implement the \\nDBMS itself.\\n1.1 The Evolution of Database System s\\nWhat is a database? In essence a database is nothing more than a collection of \\ninformation that exists over a long period of time, often many years. In common \\nparlance, the term database  refers to a collection of data that is managed by a \\nDBMS. The DBMS is expected to:\\n1. Allow users to create new databases and specify their schemas  (logical \\nstructure of the data), using a specialized data-definition language.\\n1', metadata={'page': 37, 'source': 'book/ullman_the_complete_book.pdf'}),\n",

One popular approach is the creation of data ware\\xad\\nhouses,  where information from many legacy databases is copied periodically, \\nwith the appropriate translation, to a central database. Another approach is \\nthe implementation of a mediator, or “middleware,” whose function is to sup\\xad\\nport an integrated model of the data of the various databases, while translating \\nbetween this model and the actual models used by each database.\\n1.2 Overview of a Database Management  \\nSystem\\nIn Fig. 1.1 we see an outline of a complete DBMS. Single boxes represent system \\ncomponents, while double boxes represent in-memory data structures. The solid \\nlines indicate control and data flow, while dashed lines indicate data flow only. \\nSince the diagram is complicated, we shall consider the details in several stages. \\nFirst, at the top, we suggest that there are two distinct sources of commands \\nto the DBMS:\\n1. Conventional users and application programs that ask for data or modify \\ndata.\\n2. A database administrator:  a person or persons responsible for the struc\\xad\\nture or schema  of the database.\\n1.2.1 Data-Definition Language Commands\\nThe second kind of command is the simpler to process, and we show its trail \\nbeginning at the upper right side of Fig. 1.1. For example, the database admin\\xad\\nistrator, or DBA,  for a university registrar’s database might decide that there \\nshould be a table or relation with columns for a student, a course the student \\nhas taken, and a grade for that student in that course. The DBA might also \\ndecide that the only allowable grades are A, B, C, D, and F. This structure \\nand constraint information is all part of the schema of the database. It is \\nshown in Fig. 1.1 as entered by the DBA, who needs special authority to ex\\xad\\necute schema-altering commands, since these can have profound effects on the \\ndatabase.

However, file systems do not generally guarantee that \\ndata cannot be lost if it is not backed up, and they don’ t support efficient access \\nto data items whose location in a particular file is not known.\\nFurther, file systems do not directly support item (2), a query language for \\nthe data in files. Their support for (1) — a schema for the data — is limited to \\nthe creation of directory structures for files. Item (4) is not always supported \\nby file systems; you can lose data that has not been backed up. Finally, file \\nsystems do not satisfy (5). While they allow concurrent access to files by several \\nusers or processes, a file system generally will not prevent situations such as \\ntwo users modifying the same file at about the same time, so the changes made \\nby one user fail to appear in the file.\\nThe first important applications of DBMS’ s were ones where data was com\\xad\\nposed of many small items, and many queries or modifications were made. \\nExamples of these applications are:\\n1. Banking systems: maintaining accounts and making sure that system \\nfailures do not cause money to disappear.\\n2. Airline reservation systems: these, like banking systems, require assurance \\nthat data will not be lost, and they must accept very large volumes of \\nsmall actions by customers.\\n3. Corporate record keeping: employment and tax records, inventories, sales \\nrecords, and a great variety of other types of information, much of it \\ncritical.\\nThe early DBMS’ s required the programmer to visualize data much as it \\nwas stored.

THE EVOLUTION OF DATABASE SYSTEM S 3\\ndescribing the structure of the information in a database, chief among them \\nthe “hierarchical” or tree-based model and the graph-based “network” model. \\nThe latter was standardized in the late 1960’s through a report of CODASYL \\n(Committee on Data Systems and Languages).1\\nA problem with these early models and systems was that they did not sup\\xad\\nport high-level query languages. For example, the CODASYL query language \\nhad statements that allowed the user to jump from data element to data ele\\xad\\nment, through a graph of pointers among these elements. There was consider\\xad\\nable effort needed to write such programs, even for very simple queries.\\n1.1.2 Relational Database Systems\\nFollowing a famous paper written by Ted Codd in 1970,2  database systems \\nchanged significantly. Codd proposed that database systems should present \\nthe user with a view of data organized as tables called relations.  Behind the \\nscenes, there might be a complex data structure that allowed rapid response \\nto a variety of queries. But, unlike the programmers for earlier database sys\\xad\\ntems, the programmer of a relational system would not be concerned with the \\nstorage structure. Queries could be expressed in a very high-level language, \\nwhich greatly increased the efficiency of database programmers. We shall cover \\nthe relational model of database systems throughout most of this book. SQL \\n(“Structured Query Language”), the most important query language based on \\nthe relational model, is covered extensively.\\nBy 1990, relational database systems were the norm. Yet the database field \\ncontinues to evolve, and new issues and approaches to the management of data \\nsurface regularly. Object-oriented features have infilrated the relational model. \\nSome of the largest databases are organized rather differently from those using \\nrelational methodology. In the balance of this section, we shall consider some \\nof the modern trends in database systems.\\n1.1.3 Smaller and Smaller Systems\\nOriginally, DBMS’ s were large, expensive software systems running on large \\ncomputers. The size was necessary, because to store a gigabyte of data required \\na large computer system. Today, hundreds of gigabytes fit on a single disk, \\nand it is quite feasible to run a DBMS on a personal computer. Thus, database \\nsystems based on the relational model have become available for even very small \\nmachines, and they are beginning to appear as a common tool for computer \\napplications, much as spreadsheets and word processors did before them.\\nAnother important trend is the use of documents, often tagged using XML \\n(extensible Modeling Language). Large collections of small documents can\\n1  C O D A S Y L  D ata B ase Task Group A p ril 1971 Report,  A CM , New York.\\n2C odd, E .

       " Document(page_content='Chapter 2\\nThe Relational M odel of  \\nData\\nThis chapter introduces the most important model of data: the two-dimensional \\ntable, or “relation.” We begin with an overview of data models in general. We \\ngive the basic terminology for relations and show how the model can be used to \\nrepresent typical forms of data. We then introduce a portion of the language \\nSQL — that part used to declare relations and their structure. The chapter \\ncloses with an introduction to relational algebra. We see how this notation \\nserves as both a query language — the aspect of a data model that enables us \\nto ask questions about the data — and as a constraint language — the aspect \\nof a data model that lets us restrict the data in the database in various ways.\\n2.1 An Overview of Data M odels\\nThe notion of a “data model” is one of the most fundamental in the study of \\ndatabase systems. In this brief summary of the concept, we define some basic \\nterminology and mention the most important data models.\\n2.1.1 W hat is a Data Model?\\nA data model  is a notation for describing data or information. The description \\ngenerally consists of three parts:\\n1. Structure of the data.  You may be familiar with tools in programming \\nlanguages such as C or Java for describing the structure of the data used by \\na program: arrays and structures (“structs”) or objects, for example. The \\ndata structures used to implement data in the computer are sometimes \\nreferred to, in discussions of database systems, as a physical data model,  \\nalthough in fact they are far removed from the gates and electrons that \\ntruly serve as the physical implementation of the data. In the database\\n17', metadata={'page': 53, 'source': 'book/ullman_the_complete_book.pdf'}),\n",

THE RELATIONAL MODEL OF DATA\\nworld, data models are at a somewhat higher level than data structures, \\nand are sometimes referred to as a conceptual model  to emphasize the \\ndifference in level. We shall see examples shortly.\\n2. Operations on the data.  In programming languages, operations on the \\ndata are generally anything that can be programmed. In database data \\nmodels, there is usually a limited set of operations that can be performed. \\nWe are generally allowed to perform a limited set of queries  (operations \\nthat retrieve information) and modifications  (operations that change the \\ndatabase). This limitation is not a weakness, but a strength. By limiting \\noperations, it is possible for programmers to describe database operations \\nat a very high level, yet have the database management system implement \\nthe operations efficiently. In comparison, it is generally impossible to \\noptimize programs in conventional languages like C, to the extent that an \\ninefficient algorithm (e.g., bubblesort) is replaced by a more efficient one \\n(e.g., quicksort).\\n3. Constraints on the data.  Database data models usually have a way to \\ndescribe limitations on what the data can be. These constraints can range \\nfrom the simple (e.g., “a day of the week is an integer between 1 and 7” \\nor “a movie has at most one title”) to some very complex limitations that \\nwe shall discuss in Sections 7.4 and 7.5.\\n2.1.2 Important Data Models\\nToday, the two data models of preeminent importance for database systems are:\\n1. The relational model, including object-relational extensions.\\n2. The semistructured-data model, including XML and related standards.\\nThe first, which is present in all commercial database management systems, \\nis the subject of this chapter. The semistructured model, of which XML is \\nthe primary manifestation, is an added feature of most relational DBMS’s, and \\nappears in a number of other contexts as well. We turn to this data model \\nstarting in Chapter 11.\\n2.1.3 The Relational Model in Brief\\nThe relational model is based on tables, of which Fig. 2.1 is an example. We \\nshall discuss this model beginning in Section 2.2. This relation, or table, de\\xad\\nscribes movies: their title, the year in which they were made, their length in \\nminutes, and the genre of the movie. We show three particular movies, but you \\nshould imagine that there are many more rows to this table — one row for each \\nmovie ever made, perhaps.\\nThe structure portion of the relational model might appear to resemble an \\narray of structs in C, where the column headers are the field names, and each', metadata={'page': 54, 'source': 'book/ullman_the_complete_book.pdf'})]"

      "  PASSAGE: '2.3. DEFINING  A RELATION SCHEMA IN  SQL 33 The gender attribute has values that are a single letter, M  or F. Thus, we  can safely use a single character as the type of this attribute. Finally, the  b irth d a te  attribute naturally deserves the data type D A TE. □ 2.3.4 Modifying Relation Schemas We now know how to declare a table. But what if we need to change the schema  of the table after it has been in use for a long time and has many tuples in its  current instance? We can remove the entire table, including all of its current  tuples, or we could change the schema by adding or deleting attributes. We can delete a relation R by the SQL statement: D R O P TABLE R; Relation R is no longer part of the database schema, and we can no longer  access any of its tuples. More frequently than we would drop a relation that is part of a long-lived  database, we may need to modify the schema of an existing relation. These  modifications are done by a statement that begins with the keywords ALTER  TABLE and the name of the relation. We then have several options, the most  important of which are 1. A D D  followed by an attribute name and its data type. 2. D R O P followed by an attribute name. E xam ple 2.4: Thus, for instance, we could modify the MovieStar relation by  adding an attribute phone with: ALTER TA BLE MovieStar A D D  phone CHAR(16); As a result, the MovieStar schema now has five attributes: the four mentioned  in Fig. 2.8 and the attribute phone, which is a fixed-length string of 16 bytes.  In the actual relation, tuples would all have components for phone, but we  know of no phone numbers to put there. Thus, the value of each of these  components is set to the special null value,  N U LL. In Section 2.3.5, we shall see  how it is possible to choose another “default” value to be used instead of N U L L   for unknown values. As another example, the A LTER TABLE statement: ALTER TA BLE MovieStar D R O P b irth d a te ; deletes the b irth d a te  attribute. As a result, the schema for MovieStar no  longer has that attribute, and all tuples of the current MovieStar instance  have the component for b irth d a te  deleted. □'\n",

SECONDARY STORAGE M ANAGEM ENT\\na) What are the corresponding blocks of the redundant disks?\\nb) If the third disk’s block is rewritten to be 10000000, what steps must be \\ntaken to change other disks?\\nE xercise 13.4.10: Describe the steps taken to recover from the following fail\\xad\\nures using the RAID level 6 scheme with seven disks: (a) disks 1 and 7, (b) disks \\n1 and 4, (c) disks 3 and 6.\\n13.5 Arranging D ata on Disk\\nWe now turn to the m atter of how disks are used store databases. A data \\nelement such as a tuple or object is represented by a record,  which consists of \\nconsecutive bytes in some disk block. Collections such as relations are usually \\nrepresented by placing the records that represent their data elements in one or \\nmore blocks. It is normal for a disk block to hold only elements of one relation, \\nalthough there are organizations where blocks hold tuples of several relations. \\nIn this section, we shall cover the basic layout techniques for both records and \\nblocks.\\n13.5.1 Fixed-Length Records\\nThe simplest sort of record consists of fixed-length fields,  one for each attribute \\nof the represented tuple. Many machines allow more efficient reading and writ\\xad\\ning of main memory when data begins at an address that is a multiple of 4 or 8; \\nsome even require us to do so. Thus, it is common to begin all fields at a mul\\xad\\ntiple of 4 or 8, as appropriate. Space not used by the previous field is wasted. \\nNote that, even though records are kept in secondary, not main, memory, they \\nare manipulated in main memory. Thus it is necessary to lay out the record so \\nit can be moved to main memory and accessed efficiently there.\\nOften, the record begins with a header,  a fixed-length region where infor\\xad\\nmation about the record itself is kept. For example, we may want to keep in \\nthe record:\\n1. A pointer to the schema for the data stored in the record. For example, \\na tuple’ s record could point to the schema for the relation to which the \\ntuple belongs. This information helps us find the fields of the record.\\n2. The length of the record. This information helps us skip over records \\nwithout consulting the schema.\\n3. Timestamps indicating the time the record was last modified, or last read. \\nThis information may be useful for implementing database transactions \\nas will be discussed in Chapter 18.', metadata={'page': 626, 'source': 'book/ullman_the_complete_book.pdf'}),\n",

TREE STRUCTURES FOR MULTIDIMENSIONAL DATA  675\\n! b) We wish to perform a nearest-neighbor query for the point (110,205). \\nWe begin by searching the bucket with lower-left corner at (100,200) and \\nupper-right corner at (120,250), and we find that the closest point in this \\nbucket is (115,220). What other buckets must be searched to verify that \\nthis point is the closest?\\nE xercise 14.5.6: Suppose we have a hash table whose buckets are numbered\\n0 to 2n —  1; i.e., bucket addresses are n bits long.

A simple tree scheme for accessing these points is an index of indexes, \\nor more generally a tree in which the nodes at each level are indexes for one \\nattribute.\\nThe idea is suggested in Fig. 14.37 for the case of two attributes. The \\n“root of the tree” is an index for the first of the two attributes. This index \\ncould be any type of conventional index, such as a B-tree or a hash table.
